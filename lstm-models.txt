Performance of LSTMs:

# First Attempt:
- 1000 embedding layer
- 0.1 dropout
- LSTM 100
- Dropout 0.1
- Dense 2
- LR: 0.0005
- Num words: 10000
Score (accuracy) = 80%

# Second Attempt:
- 1000 embedding layer
- 0.2 dropouts
- LSTM 200
- Dropout 0.2
- Dense 2
- LR: 0.0005
- Num words: 10000
Score (accuracy) = 78%

# Third Attempt:

- 1000 embedding layer
- 0.1 dropouts
- LSTM 200
- Dropout 0.1
- Dense 2
- LR: 0.0005
- Num words: 10000
Score (accuracy) = 80%

# Fourth Attempt:

Same as above, only between dropout 0.1 and Dense 2,
add a further Dense 100 layer with tanh activation.

This produces a mode lwith a greater accuracy level.

Score (accuracy) = 83%

# Fifth Attempt:
Using two lstm layers, one 200, one 100, with dropout between. And also dense layer at the end.

Score (accuracy) = 81.33%

Not as good for 5 epochs, but might be worth training this on further epochs as this might improve the scoring (assuming we don't overtrain).
